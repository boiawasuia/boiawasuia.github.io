These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=10-easy-and-delicious-one-bowl-meals-you-need-to-eat-asap>10 Easy And Delicious One-Bowl Meals You Need To Eat ASAP<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#10-easy-and-delicious-one-bowl-meals-you-need-to-eat-asap>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-03/24/18/enhanced/webdr15/original-21425-1458860357-1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.90W2EjL3FnxNh7qvp60FYwDMEy&pid=15.1"' alt="10 Easy And Delicious One-Bowl Meals You Need To Eat ASAP"><p><em>Source: buzzfeed.com</em></p><blockquote><p>asap.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion
